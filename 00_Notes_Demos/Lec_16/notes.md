# Access Refresh Token, Middleware and cookies in Backend

user model has refresh token and access token. this is a modern practice we can work with access token only. access token is short lived and refresh token are long lived. the concept is while we have access token we can access it. if login section is too short we need to login again and again.

Access tokens and refresh tokens are essential components of **authentication and authorization** systems, especially in **OAuth 2.0** and **JWT-based** workflows. Here's a simple breakdown of what each is and how they work:

---

### üîê Access Token

* **What it is:** A short-lived token that proves a user is authenticated.
* **Purpose:** Used to access **protected resources** (like APIs) on behalf of the user.
* **Expiration:** Typically expires quickly (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour).
* **Usage:** Sent with each request to the server, usually in the `Authorization` header like this:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```

---

### üîÑ Refresh Token

* **What it is:** A long-lived token used to **get a new access token** when the old one expires.
* **Purpose:** Keeps the user logged in without needing to log in again.
* **Expiration:** Can last from hours to months (should be securely stored and rotated).
* **Usage:** Sent to a token endpoint (e.g., `/auth/refresh`) to get a new access token.

---

### üß† How They Work Together

1. **User logs in**

   * Server verifies credentials
   * Server returns an **access token** and a **refresh token**

2. **User makes requests**

   * Access token is used in requests to protected endpoints

3. **Access token expires**

   * Client sends refresh token to get a **new access token**

4. **Refresh token is invalid or expired**

   * User must **log in again**

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Tips

* **Never store refresh tokens in localStorage** (prefer httpOnly cookies for web apps).
* **Access tokens can be stored in memory or localStorage**, but only if secure.
* Always use **HTTPS** to transmit tokens.
* Implement **token revocation** logic on logout or suspicious activity.



we will use these and write a login user 
we will use the middleware in logout to make it more save and compreshesable 
so we will be writin out own custom middleware. this will verify if there is a user or not. 

__Note lost my connection after postman video as mongoDB was not working properly but understood the concepts after it. After doing mongoDB aggregate pipeline the course is let to do it yourself all routes and controller need to be written according to the todo in the git repo so it is in form of assignment but I have got enough understanding about it to make choics and build projects so thats good. 

 There is no frontend I though It would be a fullstack project but it was only backend 

 so learn each technology and logics sperately and also learn how they interact with each other. make 2-3 project while using the minimal number of framework or libraries otherwise you will build dependency on them. 

 write more JS as to get familiar with it and other things you will learn as you go. 

 Learn GIT, Practice DSA, 3 decent projects learn Core CS thats enough
